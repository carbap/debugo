[_**Debugo**_](https://debugo.dev) is an interactive playground for the Go programming language. It lets you write, run, and debug Go code entirely in your browser. This is possible by combining the power of [Yaegi](https://github.com/traefik/yaegi) with WebAssembly.

## Features

- **Run** â€“ Write Go code, execute it, and view the results in the _Output_ tab.
- **Debug** â€“ Place breakpoints, start debugging, and continue execution until the next breakpoint.
  - Invalid breakpoints are marked with a darker red color.
- **Inspect variables** â€“ Open the _Scope_ tab during debugging to see the name, type, and value of variables.
  - Click or tap a value to either copy it to the clipboard or expand it (for objects, lists, and maps).
- **Share your code** â€“ Generate a shareable link that loads your code into the editor.
- **Code examples** â€“ Choose from a list of presets to get started.
